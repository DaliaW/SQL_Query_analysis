# Query_analysis

Analyzing SQL queries is the focus of this project. I would also like to draw to
your attention that optimizing and analyzing SQL queries is one of the most important main topics.
This project we're given 5 schemas and 17 Queries to Analyze.
The report document is the Analyze of the given Queries with and without indices.
MP2DataGenerator.eml is the data insertions to populate the Tables.
MiniProject2DB.pdf is the report of the Queries.
